# OMDB
Welcome to my proyect, to start this proyect first clone the repository, then go to back and front and run in both folders the following commands:

npm i ; 
npm start

and after that the server should be running on port 3000, so go to the browser and navigate to localhost:3000 and enjoy!


PD: I've been creating a full refresh UI for this proyect, you could check it here : https://omdb-new.herokuapp.com/ 
Login and Register features are not working. The migration will be completed in a few weeks with all the remaining features.
